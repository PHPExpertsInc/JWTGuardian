The JWT Guardian is a PHP Experts, Inc., Project meant to ease the creation of new projects.

It strives to provide drop-in JWT authentication for Laravel sites, making it as easy as possible to secure sites. 

It currently uses Tymon's JWT-Auth as the JWT driver, but I want to add more drivers in the future.

It was bootstrapped from the Standard PHP Skeleton (https://github.com/php-pds/skeleton).

## Installation

Via Composer

```bash
composer create-project phpexperts/skeleton NewProject
```

## Usage

Install a project, then remove the directories you won't need, like `bin`.

You should definitely edit the LICENSE and .travis.yml to be specific to your 
project and update the tags at the top of the README.md.

# Use cases

 ✔ Rapidly start up a project right.  
 ✔ Less time spent on boilerplating a git repo.  
 ✔ Conforms to the most widely-deployed PHP layout.  
 ✔ Fully compatible with the Bettergist Collective recommendation.  

## Testing

```bash
phpunit --testdox
```
